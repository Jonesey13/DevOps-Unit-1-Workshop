The marketing team has come back to you with some feedback. They want to put your website to a target audience that has a deathly fear of the colour green. Please adjust your story and all words to avoid anything green in it, and try and make it more "red". Maybe include more nouns like firetrucks, or post boxes, or phone booths. Marketing thinks that this will be an amazingly awesome change.
